After reading it, I selected TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) method to make keywords to be TF-IDF Vectors. Then I used cosine similarity to find similar articles to a given article. This system could perform well to a user who has only one interaction with an ariticle. \n",

In this case, the system could rely on `rank based recommendation system using` using `get_top_articles(n, df=df)` and `get_top_article_ids(n, df=df)`. The second case is a user who have interaction with an article but no information of the article in df_content like the scenario that a user having interaction with '1427' of article_id given below. In this case, `user_item` matrix could be used to find users who read the article. Then the order of the users needs to be sorted by the number of interaction. The top user is passed in `get_user_articles(user_id=top user, user_item=user_item)` to get `article_ids` and `article_names`.  Top 10 articles will be given by the order of the articles in `rank based recommendation system`.\n",

    "The last case is the opposite of the previous case that a user having one interaction and there is a information in df_content. In this case, `content based recommendation` could be excuted using `make_content_recs(article_id, df_content, df, m=10)`."
